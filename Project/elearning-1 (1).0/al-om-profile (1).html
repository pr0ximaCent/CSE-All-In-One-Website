    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><b>&ldquo;I would like to say that my 4 years at CUET has been one of the best periods in my life.&rdquo;</b></em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, this is Omar Sharif, an alumnus of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology.I completed both my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at CUET, where I had the privilege of being a part of the renowned CUET NLP Lab, led by Dr. Moshiul Hoque. My passion for research is complemented by my strong affinity for Data Structures and Algorithms. Throughout my academic journey, I actively participated in prestigious programming contests such as ICPC, NCPC, and various national-level competitions. These experiences enhanced my proficiency in programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Php, and Latex. Collaborating on group projects not only honed my technical skills but also nurtured my abilities in communication and project planning .</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I served as an Assistant Professor at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET) before embarking on an exciting new chapter as a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth in the United States. I feel incredibly fortunate to be working under the guidance of Professor Sarah M. Preum. My research endeavors primarily revolve around the captivating field of Natural Language Processing, where I aim to make significant contributions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I feel myself lucky to be an alumnus of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology. Currently, I have been serving the CUET Alumni Community as a member of CUET Alumni Association (CUAA).</p>
