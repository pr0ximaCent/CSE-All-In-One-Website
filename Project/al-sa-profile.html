    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, this is Sabiha Anan, an alumnus of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology. I completed my graduation and post-graduation from Department of Computer Science,CUET in 2018. I would like to say that my 4 years at CUET has been one of the best periods in my life. The congenial learning environment, experienced and friendly teachers, state of the art IT services, lab and other facilities of the university gave me opportunity to acquire real knowledge which helped me to advance in my career.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since then, I have been actively working as a faculty member at the same university. I started my journey at CUET as a lecturer in July 2019 and have progressed to the position of Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering. During my academic career, I have made significant contributions, including a published research paper on developing an innovative image defogging framework utilizing segmentation techniques and the dark channel prior. I got Alumni Excellence Award for outstanding contribution in the Society and Corporate Sector of Bangladesh.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I feel myself lucky to be an alumnus of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology. Currently, I have been serving the CUET Alumni Community as a member of CUET Alumni Association (CUAA).</p>
